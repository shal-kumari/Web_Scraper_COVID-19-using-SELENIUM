There are various strategies to locate elements in a page. You can use the most appropriate one for your case. 
Selenium provides the following methods to locate elements in a page:

find_element_by_id
find_element_by_name
find_element_by_xpath
find_element_by_link_text
find_element_by_partial_link_text
find_element_by_tag_name
find_element_by_class_name
find_element_by_css_selector

To find multiple elements (these methods will return a list):

find_elements_by_name
find_elements_by_xpath
find_elements_by_link_text
find_elements_by_partial_link_text
find_elements_by_tag_name
find_elements_by_class_name
find_elements_by_css_selector
Apart from the public methods given above, there are two private methods which might be useful with locators in page objects. 
These are the two private methods: find_element and find_elements.
