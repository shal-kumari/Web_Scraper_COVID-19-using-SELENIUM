                                                  **Interacting with the page**
Just being able to go to places isn’t terribly useful. 
What we’d really like to do is to interact with the pages, or, more specifically, the HTML elements within a page. 
First of all, we need to find one. WebDriver offers a number of ways to find elements. For example, given an element defined as:

<input type="text" name="passwd" id="passwd-id" />
For this we use:

element = driver.find_element_by_id("passwd-id")
element = driver.find_element_by_name("passwd")
element = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//input[@id='passwd-id']")
element.send_keys("some text")
element.send_keys(" and some", Keys.ARROW_DOWN)
element.clear()

                                                      **Filling in forms**
We’ve already seen how to enter text into a textarea or text field, but what about the other elements? 
You can “toggle” the state of the drop down, and you can use “setSelected” to set something like an OPTION tag selected. 
Dealing with SELECT tags isn’t too bad:

element = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//select[@name='name']")
all_options = element.find_elements_by_tag_name("option")
for option in all_options:
    print("Value is: %s" % option.get_attribute("value"))
    option.click()
This will find the first “SELECT” element on the page, and cycle through each of its OPTIONs in turn, printing out their values, and selecting each in turn.

As you can see, this isn’t the most efficient way of dealing with SELECT elements. 
WebDriver’s support classes include one called a “Select”, which provides useful methods for interacting with these:

from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import Select
select = Select(driver.find_element_by_name('name'))
select.select_by_index(index)
select.select_by_visible_text("text")
select.select_by_value(value)
WebDriver also provides features for deselecting all the selected options:

select = Select(driver.find_element_by_id('id'))
select.deselect_all()
This will deselect all OPTIONs from that particular SELECT on the page.

Suppose in a test, we need the list of all default selected options, Select class provides a property method that returns a list:

select = Select(driver.find_element_by_xpath("//select[@name='name']"))
all_selected_options = select.all_selected_options
To get all available options:

options = select.options
Once you’ve finished filling out the form, you probably want to submit it. One way to do this would be to find the “submit” button and click it:

# Assume the button has the ID "submit" :)
driver.find_element_by_id("submit").click()
Alternatively, WebDriver has the convenience method “submit” on every element. If you call this on an element within a form, WebDriver will walk up the DOM until it finds the enclosing form and then calls submit on that. If the element isn’t in a form, then the NoSuchElementException will be raised:

element.submit()

                                                        **Drag and drop**
You can use drag and drop, either moving an element by a certain amount, or on to another element:

element = driver.find_element_by_name("source")
target = driver.find_element_by_name("target")

from selenium.webdriver import ActionChains
action_chains = ActionChains(driver)
action_chains.drag_and_drop(element, target).perform()

Moving between windows and frames
It’s rare for a modern web application not to have any frames or to be constrained to a single window. WebDriver supports moving between named windows using the “switch_to_window” method:

driver.switch_to_window("windowName")
All calls to driver will now be interpreted as being directed to the particular window. But how do you know the window’s name? Take a look at the javascript or link that opened it:

<a href="somewhere.html" target="windowName">Click here to open a new window</a>
Alternatively, you can pass a “window handle” to the “switch_to_window()” method. Knowing this, it’s possible to iterate over every open window like so:

for handle in driver.window_handles:
    driver.switch_to_window(handle)
You can also swing from frame to frame (or into iframes):

driver.switch_to_frame("frameName")
It’s possible to access subframes by separating the path with a dot, and you can specify the frame by its index too. That is:

driver.switch_to_frame("frameName.0.child")
would go to the frame named “child” of the first subframe of the frame called “frameName”. All frames are evaluated as if from *top*.

Once we are done with working on frames, we will have to come back to the parent frame which can be done using:

driver.switch_to_default_content()
                                                        
                                                        **Popup dialogs**

Selenium WebDriver has built-in support for handling popup dialog boxes. 
After you’ve triggered action that would open a popup, you can access the alert with the following:
alert = driver.switch_to_alert()
This will return the currently open alert object. 
With this object, you can now accept, dismiss, read its contents or even type into a prompt. 
This interface works equally well on alerts, confirms, prompts. Refer to the API documentation for more information.
