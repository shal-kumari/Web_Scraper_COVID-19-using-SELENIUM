                                                  **Interacting with the page**
Just being able to go to places isn’t terribly useful. 
What we’d really like to do is to interact with the pages, or, more specifically, the HTML elements within a page. 
First of all, we need to find one. WebDriver offers a number of ways to find elements. For example, given an element defined as:

<input type="text" name="passwd" id="passwd-id" />
For this we use:

element = driver.find_element_by_id("passwd-id")
element = driver.find_element_by_name("passwd")
element = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//input[@id='passwd-id']")
element.send_keys("some text")
element.send_keys(" and some", Keys.ARROW_DOWN)
element.clear()
