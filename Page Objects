Page Objects
This chapter is a tutorial introduction to page objects design pattern. 
A page object represents an area in the web application user interface that your test is interacting.

Benefits of using page object pattern:

Creating reusable code that can be shared across multiple test cases
Reducing the amount of duplicated code
If the user interface changes, the fix needs changes in only one place
